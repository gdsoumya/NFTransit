# NFTransit

A web2.0 interface for all games to enable web3.0 token integrations the right way

## Features

* Ease integration and development by providing abstraction over web3
* Completely trustless system using Meta Txs, removing the necessity of secondary admins/managers with elevated contract permissions
* Can handle both fungible and non-fungible assets using ERC-1155
* Can also be operated completely independent of NFTransit by self-hosting or direct blockchain interactions
* Ability to not only bring items from the game into the blockchain but also has the ability to bring back the tokens into the game as playable items making sure the utility of the assets remain intact
